# godot_spring_todo
This is a basic implementation of a godot based 
ToDo list application. It also includes a basic dummy backend.

## Starting
### Build Backend
```
./mvnw clean package
```

### Start Docker
```
docker-compose up
```
The frontend is running on port 8080.

The frontend is prebuild in the 'frontend_build' folder.
This means Godot is not requierd to build the project.
